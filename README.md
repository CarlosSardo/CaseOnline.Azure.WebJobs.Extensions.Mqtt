This repository contains the code for the CaseOnline.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Mqtt NuGet Package. This package enables you to trigger an Azure Function based on a MQTT Subscription. By binding a MqttTrigger attribute as an input parameter for your function, you'll receive messages of type PublishedMqttMessage. Internally this is wired up using [MQTTnet](https://github.com/chkr1011/MQTTnet).

## How to use
- Create an Azure Function using [Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-develop-vs) or using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/tutorials/functions-extension/getting-started)
- Make sure your ```Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Functions``` package version is 1.0.7 or higher
- Install the [CaseOnline.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Mqtt](https://www.nuget.org/packages/CaseOnline.Azure.WebJobs.Extensions.Mqtt/) NuGet package in you Functions Project
- Add the Mqtt server settings to your 'local.settings.json' during development time or to your appsettings when running on Azure:
    - MqttServer (just the dns/hostname)
    - MqttUsername
    - MqttPassword
    - MqttPort (optional, defaults to 1883)
    - MqttClientId (optional, defaults to a random Guid)
- When deploying/running on Azure set/ad the application-setting ```FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION``` to ```beta```
- Add a ```MqttTrigger``` attribute to your function parameters:

    ```
    public static void MyFunction([MqttTrigger(new[] { "my/mqtt/topic" })]PublishedMqttMessage message) 
    ```

- Deploy / Run your function. Azure function will subscripe to the Mqtt server/topic(s) and trigger your function when messages get published

## Beta - Work in progress!!
The code currently works as it is but I have to make it better configurable before I publish it as a NuGet Package. Things that have to be done:
- Have more beta-testers running/using it (please help! ðŸ˜‡)
- Create more Unit Tests & Integration tests and get code coverage to >80%
- Use ILogger instead of TraceWriter which currently does not output on dev machine for some reason? 
- Create demos for integrations with CloudMqtt.net and Azure IoT Hub

Expect a 1.0.0 version of the NuGet package in April '18.

## Custom MQTT-Client Configuration
Internally the [MQTTnet](https://github.com/chkr1011/MQTTnet) is used for the Mqtt implementation.  For complexer configurations, for example if you want to 
- use Tls
- pecial certificates 
- custom logic for setting the topics/clientId 
- connecting over websockets
- control the QoS level per topic

To do this, implemented a custom ```ICreateMqttConfig``` and provide this Type as parameter to the ```MqttTrigger``` like this:
    
```
public static void MyFunction([MqttTrigger(typeof(MyMqttConfigProvider))]PublishedMqttMessage message)
```
     
In your implementation of ```ICreateMqttConfig``` you need to return an instance of abstract class ```MqttConfig``` which requires you to implement a property of type ```IManagedMqttClientOptions```. Examples on how to build an instance of ```IManagedMqttClientOptions``` are available in the  [ManagedClient wiki of MQTTnet](https://github.com/chkr1011/MQTTnet/wiki/Client).

An example of this custom client configuration is implemented in [this function](./src/ExampleFunctions/ExampleFunctions.cs#L34). 

## Examples
Please find some samples here in the [sample project](./src/ExampleFunctions/). The simple example subscribes to a topic where [Owntracks](http://owntracks.org/) publishes location information.
